# Class configuration file for EpiCarlo
#
# SECTIONS:
#  Each [SECTION] defines a specific class object. 
#
# OPTIONS:
#  option=value
#   Each option within a section will create a variable BY THE SAME NAME in the 
#   instantiated class object with its value set to "=value"
#
# I.e.
#  "name=Hydrogen" creates a variable called "name" in the class object with 
#  the value of "Hydrogen" 
#  
# Creating a new optionname=somevalue will create a new variable in the 
# class object. The class does not need to be edited. 
# 
# FORMAT:
#  [hydrogen]
#  option=value
#  Lines starting with "#" are ignored. 
#  Lines with "#" AFTER DATA ARE NOT IGNORED. 
#   I.e. name=Hydrogen # This comment will screw things up
#  Do NOT use quotes for text values.
