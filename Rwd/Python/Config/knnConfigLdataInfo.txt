dfuncVarSetList: The variable sets selected for nearest neighbour analysis from DFUNCT.csv; Enter -1 to indicate that DFUNCT.csv will not be used; Enter -99 to select ALL variable sets in DFUNCT.csv
useDfuncVarCoef: Yes if coeficients are to be used otherwise No (discriminant function coeficients will not be applied.  
largeDatasetReadLines:The number of lines in a file to be read; analyzed; and written to file at any one time; reference dataset is to be held in memory in its entirety.
printMultipleFiles: YES or NO; Where multiple variable sets are being processed you may choose to print them to a single file or multiple files differentiated by the variable set number.
