drive: Enter the drive you are not using your default drive (usually c on windows machine)
cmeansDataInPath: Enter the path where existing files are to be read
cmeansDataOutPath: Enter the path where new files are to be written; default is cmeansDataInPath if left blank
errorFilePath: Enter the file path for writing errors related to datasets that do not conform with types assigned in data dictionary (e.g. \Rwd\Python\PyReadError\); default is cmeansDataInPath if left blank 
dataDictionaryFilePath: Enter file path for data dictionary if it exists (e.g. \Rwd\Python\DATDICT\); default is cmeansDataInPath if left blank   
dataDictionaryFileName: Enter the name of the data dictionary; e.g. DATDIC.csv; If no data dictionary leave blank
cmeansGnoRange: Enter the range in number of groups; minimum and maximum inclusive separated by a comma
cmeansError: Enter the error tolerance for completion of the Fuzzy C-means algorithm; 0.001 or less recommended 
cmeansDataFileName:Enter the source data file from which variables will be selected to do Fuzzy c-means
cmeansDataUniqueIds:Name of variable containing unique ID for each row of input; e.g. LVI_FCOID 
cmeansVariableSelect: Enter a filename; e.g. cmeansVarSelect; where the X-Variables used for clustering are defined 
cmeansVariableSelectCriteria: Enter a Y to indicate a Y-Variable or an X to indicate an X-Variable
cmeansMValue: This controls the degree of fuzziness; generally recommended as 2 and must be > 1
classificationType: FCM_E is Euclidean distance; FCM_CE is Censored Euclidean (zero's treated as no data)
normalizeData: Enter Yes if you wish to use a normalized dataset; otherwise enter No
normStatsTableName: Normalization Statistics - means and standard deviations for each of the selected variables (e.g. STATSNORM.csv)
